#
# Extension to MIME type mapping for static content
#
# By default, the system supports the following:
# js: text/javascript
# json: application/json
# xml: application/xml
# html: text/html
# htm: text/html
# txt: text/plain
# css: text/css
#
# Any other extensions are served as application/octet-stream
#
# The following mime.types configuration contains only 2 key-values.
# This is intentional to test that this custom mime-types.yml can be loaded.
#
mime.types:
  pdf: 'application/pdf'
  xdoc: 'application/x-word'
